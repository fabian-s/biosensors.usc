Description: Biosensor data have the potential to improve disease control and detection. However, 
             the analysis of these data under free-living conditions is not feasible with current 
             statistical techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce a new functional 
             representation of biosensor data, termed the glucodensity, together with a data 
             analysis framework based on distances between them. The new data analysis procedure 
             is illustrated through an application in diabetes with continuous-time glucose 
             monitoring (CGM) data. In this domain, we show marked improvement with respect to 
             state-of-the-art analysis methods. In particular, our findings demonstrate that (i) 
             the glucodensity possesses an extraordinary clinical sensitivity to capture the 
             typical biomarkers used in the standard clinical practice in diabetes; (ii) previous 
             biomarkers cannot accurately predict glucodensity, so that the latter is a richer 
             source of information and; (iii) the glucodensity is a natural generalization of the 
             time in range metric, this being the gold standard in the handling of CGM data. 
             Furthermore, the new method overcomes many of the drawbacks of time in range metrics 
             and provides more indepth insight into assessing glucose metabolism.
